![Bulkhead Pattern](./bulkhead.png)

One of the most overlooked resilience patterns and back end systems is the **bulkhead pattern.**

Here's the problem:

Imagine your app has one big thread pool for everything - background jobs, user uploads, payments, notifications.

Suddenly image uploads spike and hog every thread...

Now payments are delayed, notifications fail, everything slows to a crawl...

The Bulkhead (isolation) Pattern says to isolate your workloads.

Give uploads their own thread pool, give payments their own queue

Run notifications on a different worker.

Now if uploads flood the system, payments keep flowing, notifications still go out, no domino effect.

In practice, this might mean spinning up separate services, containers or worker pools for critical paths, but your system becomes fault tolerant.

Not everything breaks when one part gets overwhelmed.

So if you're designing something with multiple features or subsystems, keep Bulkhead Isolation in mind.

Don't let one leaky fixture sink the whole ship.
