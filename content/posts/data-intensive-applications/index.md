Every serious engineer needs to read [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321).

It's hands down the best book I've ever read in my entire career.

It breaks down advanced concepts behind how distributed systems, databases, and scaling works in a way that's super easy to understand.
Read it and you'll instantly level up - I guarantee it.
